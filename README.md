# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview/Background
Martha a friend and senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they’ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
The data Martha and I will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what Martha is looking for, we have decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, Martha and I decided on a clustering algorithm. We will use data visualizations to share our findings with the board. 

Tools used
  SCIkit-learn  runs statistically functions and computations
  Plotly graphing library 
  Hvplot high level plotting library that uses holovViews and bokeh
  Pandas : read data into dataframes and much much more
